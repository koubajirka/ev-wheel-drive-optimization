# ev-wheel-drive-optimization
Modelling and optimizing the ride of an automobile with independent electric wheel drive

## Description
This project deals with mathematical modelling of on-road vehicles. A spatial dynamic
model of a four-wheeled vehicle is introduced. The spatial model of the four-wheeled
vehicle is then used for a parametric study of the vehicle and research of the influence of
various suspension-related parameter values on driving characteristics and crew comfort.
Collected data are then used in optimizing the torque distribution and wheel turning
during a Skid Pad test. The optimization of torque distribution itself is carried out by
search of the minimal value of the divergence from the prescribed route, for the demanded
movement criteria.

Key features:
- 6DOF dynamic model of an on-road vehicle
- Torque distribution optimization using minimisation of divergence from the prescribed route
- Parametric study of the vehicle's suspension setup
